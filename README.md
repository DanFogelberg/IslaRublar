PS. Greate theme with a really neat and clean code. Amazing how fast you managed to make it work! <3

1. index.php:53-57 - Could've used an array to loop through calendars for a cleaner code and easier maintenance.
2. index.php:29,40,47,63-65 - Room names and prices should be printed as variables instead of hardcoded values for future updates.
3. functions.php:9,21 - $hotelDb could be a parameter that the functions accept incase of change of path.
4. form.php:13 - Remember to use variable names that explains the code and usage. roomId would be better than roomtype.
5. index.php:78 - Input "transferCode" should have an required attribute or a validation inside form.php.
6. hotel.db: - Could've created an table for "hotel info" for dynamic usage.
7. index.php:29,40,47 - Change h2-tags to h3-tags for better accessability.
8. form.php:11, 54, 63 - Spelling correction. Remember to check spelling before deployment or install an extension to avoid sloppy language.
9. style.css: - Few more paddings and margins would be nice to accomplish a better user interface.
10. Overall - Remember to use consistent casing for variables. Choose one and use it through out each language ie. Kebab case or Camel case.
